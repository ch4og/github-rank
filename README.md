# Github Rank

Recreation of "github stats card" rank from
[github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#github-stats-card)
on python.

It is very slow and shouldn't be used anywhere, it was made just for fun.

## Usage

```bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5000/?user=<username>` in browser.
